# ROSA
A real time operating system (ROSA) for the AVR32 microcontroller

## Description
The real time operating system (ROSA) is built for the AVR32 microntoller on top of a pre-existing operating system utilizing a non-preemtptive, cooperative scheduler, with static task allocation. New customer requirements have introduced a need for a fixed priority, preemptive scheduler, with dynamic task allocation. System clock ticks needed to be introduced along with relative and absolute delay functionality to facilitate periodic task execution.
